### Validation (validating webhook)

Allowing an approve/deny stage for API requests, there are some common use cases:
  - Ensuring standards - eg, labels, resource limits
  - Security tools
  - Protection of important objects/CRDs
  - Rejecting invalid spec

--

  - Istio sidecar injection
  - Adding context - eg, labels, annotations etc.
  - Removing invalid fields
